[![Link SDK][3]][4]

[![Build Status][1]][2]
[![Gem Version][13]][14]

Turn this:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;


contract Widgets {
  struct Widget {
    uint256 id;
    uint32 color;
    string name;
  }

  mapping (uint256 => Widget) private widgets;

  function createWidget(uint256 id, uint32 color, string memory name) public {
    require(widgets[id].id != id);

    widgets[id].id = id;
    widgets[id].color = color;
    widgets[id].name = name;
  }

  function getWidget(uint256 id) public view returns (uint32 color, string memory name) {
    Widget memory widget = widgets[id];
    return (widget.color, widget.name);
  }
}
```

...into this:

```
POST /createWidget
{"id":1,"color":"0x3090f0","name":"anvil"}
# => {}

GET /getWidget?id=1
# => {"color":"0x3090f0","name":"anvil"}
```

Link is a hosted platform for deploying Ethereum smart contracts as conventional web APIs,
instantly taking you from **code** to **production**. No fuss, no orchestration to manage.
Link runs your code, and you use it.

## Getting Started

[Sign up][5] for Blockmason Link. It's free to get started.

Once you're in, you can use the provided demo project to experiment.

Reveal and copy the project's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, which are both required for *authentication*.

Take a look at your project's **API**, which tells you which API calls are available after authenticating.

## Installing

To add this gem to your app (assuming your app is using [Bundler][6]), add the following line to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'blockmason-link'
```

Alternatively, to install this gem for local experimentation (such as in a Ruby REPL or CLI tools):

```
gem install blockmason-link -P HighSecurity
```

> üí° The `-P HighSecurity` flag is optional, but recommended. See [RubyGems Security][11] for details.

## Usage

In your app where you intend to use the Link SDK, include the following `require` statement to import the gem:

```ruby
require 'blockmason/link'
```

To get a client for your Link project, create an instance of a `Blockmason::Link::Project`:

```ruby
project = Blockmason::Link::Project.new(client_id: '<client-id>', client_secret: '<client-secret>')
```

> üí° Inject the `client_id` and `client_secret` any way you wish. We recommend using a live secrets
> store like [Vault][7], or using [environment variables][8].

Once you have a `Project` instance, you can perform `#get()` and `#post()` requests like this:

```ruby
# Sample GET request (based on the default Link project)
project.get('/helloWorld')
# => {"message":"Hello, world!"}
```

```ruby
# Sample POST request
project.post('/createWidget', id: 1, color: 0x3090f0, name: 'anvil')
# => {}
```

For full documentation, see the generated RDoc [API Reference][12].
